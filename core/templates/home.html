  <h1>Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Nadav Vitri</h1>
  <p>
    <br />
    I began my career in 2019, focusing on backend engineering â€” although Iâ€™ve been into computers since I was a kid ðŸ˜Š.
    <br /><br />
    I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean, efficient code and take pride in constantly learning and improving as a developer. Whether itâ€™s exploring a new technology, optimizing performance, or mentoring others, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to grow.
    <br /><br />
    This site is a small personal project to learn Django â€” and a space to share what Iâ€™m exploring along the way.
    <br /><br />
