# Nadav Vitri personal website

## Introduction

This personal website is a small project I built to practice my skills with Django and Python - for fun, learning, and as a place to share my journey and things I enjoy.

## Project Structure

Here’s a simplified structure of the project:

```text
my_site/
├── core/
├── posts/
├── templates/
├── static/
├── manage.py
```

### Apps

- **core** – Handles static pages like the homepage, CV, and reading list.
- **posts** – Manages blog posts created by me via the Django admin panel.

## Posts and Content

Posts are powered by two models:

- `Post`
  - Contains `title`, `content` (in Markdown), `slug` (optional, can be genereated from title), `created_at`, `updated_at` and `is_published`.
  - Markdown content is rendered in the template for easy formatting.
- `Attachment`
  - Linked to posts to store optional files (one post to many attachments)

All posts are created through the Django admin panel for simplicity.
Post content is rendered as Markdown by adding custom markdown filter.
